# Dockerized Kannel SMS Gateway with GoIP SMPP Configuration
This project provides a Dockerized solution for deploying Kannel, an open-source SMS gateway, configured to connect to a GoIP device via the SMPP (Short Message Peer-to-Peer) protocol. Kannel is a powerful tool for sending and receiving SMS, while GoIP is a popular hardware device for managing SMS and VoIP communications. This setup ensures seamless integration between the two systems, ideal for large-scale SMS messaging applications.
